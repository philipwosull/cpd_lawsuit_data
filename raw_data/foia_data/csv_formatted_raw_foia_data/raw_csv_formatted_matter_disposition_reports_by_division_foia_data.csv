The mother signed a criminal complaint against the decedent who resisted arrest and spat on the officers. When police inquired about medications or a history of mental illness, they were told he had none. When told to go to court the next morning, he fought officers and was tasered in response. Paramedics brought him to a hospital to have the taser probes removed. There, he became combative with officers and hospital staff. An asp and taser were deployed,and hospital staff gave him an injection. The decedent had a reaction to the shot and died. Plaintiff alleges that officers and a detention aide subjected the decedents to multiple incidents of excessive force, including unreasonable use of a Taser, and failed to provide the decedent with mental health treatment while in police custody, resulting in his death.
